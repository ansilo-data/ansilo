# Welcome to Ansilo

Ansilo is a stateless postgres container with JWT auth and a universal foreign data wrapper, making it simple to build interopable data products on top of your existing databases.

The vision for Ansilo is to massively reduce the burden of having data spread across multiple databases or vendors by leveraging [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) and [SQL/MED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL/MED) to provide a simple and standards-compliant interface to query, copy or move data across disparate systems.

If you would like to see how Ansilo can help your organisation then check out some of the potential [use cases](/category/use-cases/).

If you want to start developing with Ansilo then read through our [development guides](/category/getting-started/).
