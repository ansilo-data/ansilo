# Welcome to Ansilo

Ansilo is the first decentralised data integration platform. 
We believe that standardising a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) interface into every data store is the ultimate
solution to Data Mesh, ETL, Virtualisation and more.

If you would like to see how Ansilo can help your organisation then check out some of the potential [use cases](/category/use-cases/).

If you want to start developing with Ansilo then read through our [development guides](/category/getting-started/).

Ansilo is currently approaching its first Beta release. Stay tuned for more updates!
