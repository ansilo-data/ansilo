# Data Mesh

Ansilo has been designed from the ground up to enable organisations to build a secure, robust and scalable [Data Mesh](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/).

### Decentralised Data Domains

At the heart of the Data Mesh architecture is the decomposition of data ownership into discrete domains.
Ansilo is deployed as a **lightweight sidecar container alongside each service or data store**.
This enables teams to design, expose or ingest data products autonomously, within their existing pipeline and SDLC.

### Self-Service Data Catalog 

With minimal setup required, each instance of Ansilo can be configured to expose the data product 
for their respective business domain. 

The Ansilo workbench provides a self-service interface into each data product.
Ansilo will **automatically generate a data catalog** that documents the schema, types, versions and more. 
Each product can be queried or ingested using the workbench interface using SQL.

Data products can even be **exposed in realtime**, using the powerful SQL translation engine.
Ansilo will execute optimised queries for the underlying data store as required for each data product.

### Federated Governance

Ansilo exposes every data product through an industry-standard [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) interface,
regardless of the underlying platform. This provides a **unified SQL interface into data stores**, whether
they are relational, NoSQL or even flat-files.

With Ansilo you can federate access to every data store **using an organisation-wide IdP** that supports [Json Web Tokens](https://jwt.io)
(Active Directory, Okta, Auth0, etc).
